Snippets from Syllabus:

Candidates will be required to acquire knowledge and understanding of AD/AS analysis and should be
provided with opportunities to use this analysis to explore recent and current economic behaviour. They should
understand, and be able to analyse and evaluate, macroeconomic policy.
Candidates should have a good knowledge of developments in the UK economy and government policies over
the past ten years. 

Macroeconomic
Indicators: 
Candidates should be familiar with the data which is commonly used to measure
the performance of an economy, e.g. GDP, GDP per capita, Consumer Price and
Retail Price Indices (CPI/RPI), unemployment, and the balance of payments on
current account. Inflation and Deflation. Interest Rates.  exchange rates.

The Economic Cycle:
Candidates should understand the concept of the economic cycle and be
able to use a range of economic indicators, such as GDP, the rate of inflation,
unemployment and investment, to identify the various phases of the economic
cycle. They should be able to distinguish between demand-side and supply-side
shocks.
An understanding of potentially inflationary, positive, and potentially deflationary,
negative, output gaps is also expected in the context of the economic cycle.
Candidates should understand that positive output gaps occur when actual GDP
is above the productive potential of the economy, and negative output gaps occur
when actual GDP is below the economyâ€™s productive potential.

Uses of National Income Data:
Candidates should be able to discuss the use and limitations of national income
data to draw conclusions on living standards. They should be able to interpret
different types of economic data, such as the Human Development Index, and
use them to compare the living standards of the residents of different countries.
They should be able to discuss the limitations of using such data to arrive at
conclusions.

"and the application does not need to incorporate data for every country."

With regards to this, syllabus only really refers to UK, EU Countries and US.
So should be fine to include data for:
	- * UK
	- Couple of EU Countries (* Germany, * France, *Spain, *Italy etc.)
	- * US
	- Maybe *Japan, *China, *India, *Russia (Mix things up a bit)
